## About Scobo
Scobo is the vanilla PHP search provider, Matt started developing this library when he got tired of seeing that Laravel scout was the only abstract option. Worse it only worked with laravel projects. He set out to create a library that works for everyone.

#### Where'd the name come from?
Scobo is latin for look into, probe, scope out or search. This title seems very fitting considering the goal of Scobo is to be an easy to use search library.
